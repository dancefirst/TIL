## And Today I Have Questions

Future me easily can answer the below...

- How can I draw multiple plots in R?

- Is there any environment concept in R just linke Python?

- How can I control data type for each variable in R?



## R programming practices

- In overall, it seems simliar to SQL commands, in terms of a line of direct command sequences.

- I need to get used to the popular R library, there would be lots of convenient functions to use.

- `%>%` seems a little bit uncomfortable for me, but I will get used to it soon.

```r
### arbuthnot data
data(arbuthnot) # load data
dim(arbuthnot) # check data dimension
names(arbuthnot) # check variable names
arbuthnot$boys # view only 'boys' variable

### present data
data(present) # load data
present$boys + present$girls # calculate summation of boys, girls value

present <- present %>% mutate(total = boys + girls) # create new variable
present <- present %/% mutate(prop_boys = boys / total) # create new variable
ggplot(data = present, aes(x = year, y = prop_boys)) + geom_point() # scatter plot

present <- present %>% mutate(more_boys = boys > girls) # create boolean variable
ggplot(data=present, aes(x=year, y=more_boys)) + geom_point() # scatter plot

present <- present %>% mutate(prop_boy_girl = boys / girls) # create new variable
ggplot(data=present, aes(x=year, y=prop_boy_girl)) + geom_point() # scatter plot

### nycflights data
data(nycflights)
names(nycflights)
str(nycflights) # structure of data

ggplot(data=nycflights, aes(x=dep_deploy)) + geom_histogram() # histogram
ggplot(data=nycflights, aes(x=dep_deploy)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=15) # bin width control

rdu_flights <- nycflights %>% filter(dest == "RDU") # conditional filtering
rdu_flights %>% summarise(mean_dd = mean(dep_deploy), sd_dd = sd(dep_delay), n = n()) # summarise

sfo_feb_flights <- nycflights %>% filter(dest=="SFO", month==2)
str(sfo_feb_flights)
ggplot(data=sfo_feb_flights, aes(x = arr_delay)) + geom_histogram() # histogram

### find carrier by IQR
sfo_feb_flights %>% group_by(carrier) %>% summarise(mean_dd = mean(dep_deploy)) %>% arrange(desc(mean_dd)) # groupby, summarise and arrange by desc order
sfo_feb_flights %>% group_by(carrier) %>% summarise(mean_ad = mean(arr_delay), iqr_ad = IQR(arr_delay)) %>% arrange(desc(iqr_ad))

### find month by mean depature deploy
nycflights %>% group_by(month) %>% summarise(mean_dd = mean(dep_deploy)) %>% arrange(desc(mean_dd))
nycflights %>% group_by(month) %>% summarise(median_dd = median(dep_deploy)) %>% arrange(desc(median_dd))
ggplot(nycflights, aes(x = factor(month), y = dep_deploy)) + geom_boxplot() # boxplot

### create varialbe for deapture on-time or not
nycflights <- nycflights %>% mutate(dep_type = ifelse(dep_deploy < 5, "on time", "delayed")) # boolean variable
nycflights %>% group_by(origin) %>% summarise(ot_dep_rate = sum(dep_type == "on time") / n()) %>% arrange(desc(ot_dep_rate))

### find tailnum by average speed
nycflights <- nycflights %>% mutate(avg_speed = distance / air_time)
str(nycflights)
nycflights %>% group_by(tailnum) %>% summarise(mean_avg_speed = mean(avg_speed)) %>% arrange(desc(mean_avg_speed))
ggplot(nycflights, aes(x = avg_speed, y = distance)) + geom_point() # scatter plot
nycflights %>% group_by(tailnum) %>% summarise(max_avg_speed = max(avg_speed)) %>% arrange(desc(max_avg_speed))

### find on-time rate by depature delayed or not
nycflights <- nycflights %>% mutate(arr_type = ifelse(arr_delay <= 0, 1, 0))
nycflights %>% group_by(dep_type) %>% summarise(on_time_arr_rate = mean(arr_type))
```
