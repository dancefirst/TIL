Today I Learn, 2022.01.22



## And Today I Have Questions

Future me easily can answer the below...

* What's the difference betwen "confounding variables" and "latent variable"? Somewhat similar but different. 
  
  * How can it be explained in terms of causality?

* For statistial modeling, how could I process "confounding variables"? 
  
  * Should I take them as "bias" and try to minimize their effects on model?

* Given SUPER large time-series data for stock price prediction, which sampling strategy is the most proper?
  
  * What standard could I choose?
  
  * Benefits and drawbacks of choosing one scheme over another
- Random sampling leads generalizability and random assignment leads causality.
  
  - Do I have a proper understanding on this?

principles of experiment design

more on blocking

- design an experiment investigating whether energy gels help you run faster:
  
  - treatment: energy gel
  
  - control: no energy gel

- energy gels might affect pro and amateur atheletes differently

- block for pro status:
  
  - divide the sample to pro and amateur
  
  - randomly assign pro and amateur athletes to treatment and control groups
  
  - pro and amateur athletes are equally represented in both groups



blocking vs. explanatory variables

* Stratified sampling allows for controlling for possible confounders in the sampling stage, 

* while blocking allows for controlling for such variables during random assignment.

random sample assignment

1. sampling
   
   1. pick some representative portion of the entire population

2. assignment
   
   1. put samples into different segment/ category
