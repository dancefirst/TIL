## And Today I Have Questions:

- It seems interesting that 'predictive analysis' is introduced as more difficult task than 'inferential analysis'. Well, in this case, the meaning/standard for 'difficulty' seems different.
  
  - For the same reason, "mechanistic analysis" introduced as "the most difficult task" seems... Well, the amount of resources - time, money, infrastructure - must be "difficult" things obviously...

- I wonder other ways to overcome "confounders" - adjust or fix variables? How to?

## Types of Data Science Questions

In order of difficulty,

1. Descriptive
2. Exploratory
3. Inferential
4. Predictive
5. Causal
6. Mechanistic

### Descriptive

Goal: **Describe or summarize a set of data**

- Early analysis when received new data
- Generate simple summaries about the samples and their measurements
  - Eg: measures of central tendency or measures of variability
- **NOT for generalizing the results of the analysis to a larger population or trying to make conclusions**

### Exploratoy analysis

Goal: **Examine the data and find relationships that weren't previously known**

- Explore how different variables might be related
- Useful for discovering new connections
- Help to **formulate hypotheses and drive the design of future studies and data collection**

**"Correlation does not imply causation!"**

### Inferential analysis

Goal: **Use a relatively small sample of data to say something about the population at large**

- Provide your estimate of the variable for the population and provide your uncertainty about your estimate
- Ability to accruately infer information about the larger population depends heavily on **sampling scheme**

### Predictive analysis

Goal: **Use current and historical data to make predictions about future data**

- Accuracy in predictions is dependent on **sample size**
- Many ways to build up prediction models with some being better or worse for specific cases,
  - **More data and a simple model generally performs well** at predicting future outcomes

**"Just becuase one variable may predict another, it does not mean that one causes the other"**

- you are just capitalizing on this observed relationship to predict the second variable.

### Causal analysis

Goal: **See what happens to one variable when we manipulate another variable** - looking at the **cause** and **effect** of a **relationship**

- Gold standard in data analysis
- Often applied to the results of randomized studies that were designed to identify causation
- Usually analysed in aggregate and observed relationships are usually average effects

### Mechanistic analysis

Goal: **Understand the exact changes in variables that lead to exact changes in other variables**

- Applied to simple situations or those that are nicely modeled by deterministic equations
- Commonly applied to physical or engineering sciences
  - Eg: Biological sciences, are far too noisy to use mechanistic analysis
- Often, the only noise in the data is measurement error

## Experimental Design

1. Formulate your question (in advance of any data collection)
2. Design your experiment
3. Identify problems and sources of error
4. Collect the data

### Example

1. Does shoe size affect literacy?
2. Measure 100 individuals shoe size and test their literacy level
3. Confound?

**Hypothesis**

Shoe size (independent variable=factor) -> Literacy (dependent variable)

**Confounder**

Age -> Shoe size & Literacy

- affect independent, dependent variable at the same time
1. Does shoe size affect literacy?
2. Measure 100 individuals shoe size and test their literacy level
3. Confound: Age
   1. Adjust or fix
4. Collect the data

### How to overcome confounder?

- Random subjects assignment (control / treatment group)
  - By doing so, we can minimize the potential effects from confounder (eg. age)

**Replicates!**

- More experiments on more samples increase the quality of the experimental result.

## R code practices

```r
# creating vectors (only contain same data type)
x <- c(0.5, 0.6) ## numeric
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE) ## logical
x <- c(T, F) ## logical
x <- c("a", "b", "c") ## character
x <- 9:29 ## integer
x <- c(1+0i, 2+4i) ## complex

# initialize vector
x <- vector("numeric", length = 10)

# mixing objects in one vector - COERCION occurs!
y <- c(1.7, "a") ## character
y <- c(TRUE, 2) ## numeric
y <- c("a", TRUE) ## character

# Explicit Coercion
# objects can be explicitly coerced from one class to another 
# using the as.* functions, if available.
x <- 0:6
class(x) # "integer"
as.numeric(x) # [1] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
as.logical(x) # [1] FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
as.character(x) # [1] "0" "1" "2" "3" "4" "5" "6"

# nonsensical coercion results in NAS.
x <- c("a", "b", "c")
as.numeric(x) # [1] NA NA NA
as.logical(x) # [1] NA NA NA
as.complex(x) # [1] 0+0i 1+0i 2+0i 3+0i 4+0i 5+0i 6+0i

## LISTS
x <- list(1, "a", TRUE, 1+4i)
x 
# [[1]] [1] 1
# [[2]] [1] "a"
# [[3]] [1] TRUE
# [[4]] [1] 1+4i
```
